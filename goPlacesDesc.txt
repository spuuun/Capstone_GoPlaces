I worked with 3 other teammates to create
an itinerary-building web application. Myself
and the group made use of data retrieved
from 4 external API's, and exposed that
data to the end-user in a searchable format.
I was responsible for retrieving and parsing
data regarding events and meetups from
Eventbrite's APIThe user is able to view
their search results and add items to their
itinerary, which is also displayed. The group
also used json-server for persistent data
storage, Git and GitHub to manage
workflow, and JavaScript/HTML5/CSS to
create and style our webpage.

Go Places is a web application for adventurers. Whether you prefer to travel a little more off the map, or are looking for more local gems/ finer detail. 
Go Places, unlike the hoardes on hoardes of trip-planners and itenerary builders littering the WWW, helps users track the places they're exploring in real time.
When you have an experience, or find a dope spot -- simply add a new place to your adventure map. Add a detaied description right there, or add one later. You can publish your adventures for your friends to enjoy or reference; or you can keep them private --- use the adventure as a sort of digital scrapbook.
